# droidstarchart

Droidstarchart intends to revive the elegant but obsolete [Mobilestarchart](http://mobilestarchart.sourceforge.net/) 
in the world of high-end smartphones.

Unline many apps that bombards you with fancy animations and photos of planets, 
this app takes away those distractions and presents you a "vanilla-flavoured" star map,
so you can focus on the serious scientific details of each star.
For example, it can run on e-ink based Android device to create a Marauder's Map experience (yes just like Harry Potter!)

## Star catalog

All stars positions are accurately registered with the Positions and Proper Motions Star Catalogue (PPM).

Other star catalog yet to implement in this app:
* NGC - New General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars
* WDS - Washington Double Star Catalog (WDS)

## Current feature

* Display all stars up to Mag6
* Constellation lines and constellation labels are displayed.
* Projection on the Cartesian grid.

## Planned feature

* Basic dynamic control, such as panning and zooming
* Display the zenith and the horizon based on user's current location
* Spherical projection
* Query based searching of NGC catalog
* Real time tracking of satellites such as the international space station (ISS).
